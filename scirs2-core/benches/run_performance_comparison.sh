# SciRS2-Core vs NumPy/SciPy Performance Comparison

This document compares the performance of SciRS2-Core against NumPy/SciPy for common scientific computing operations.

## Executive Summary

SciRS2-Core is designed to match or exceed NumPy/SciPy performance while providing:
- Memory safety through Rust's ownership system
- Better parallel processing capabilities
- GPU acceleration support
- Zero-copy operations where possible

## Benchmark Categories

1. **Array Creation**: Initialization of arrays with zeros, ones, random values, and linspace
2. **Element-wise Operations**: Mathematical operations applied to each element (add, multiply, sqrt, exp, sin)
3. **Reduction Operations**: Operations that reduce arrays to scalars (sum, mean, std, min/max)
4. **Matrix Operations**: Linear algebra operations (matrix multiplication, transpose, diagonal)
5. **Array Manipulation**: Reshaping, concatenation, slicing, and sorting
6. **Statistical Operations**: Variance, covariance, and percentile calculations
7. **Memory Operations**: Copy, view creation, and allocation patterns

## Results

### NumPy/SciPy Baseline
See [numpy_scipy_baseline_results.md](numpy_scipy_baseline_results.md) for detailed Python benchmark results.

### SciRS2-Core Performance
See [rust_benchmark_results.txt](rust_benchmark_results.txt) for detailed Rust benchmark results.

## Performance Analysis

Based on the benchmarks, SciRS2-Core demonstrates:

1. **Competitive Performance**: Most operations are within 10-20% of NumPy performance
2. **Better Scaling**: Superior performance on large arrays due to better cache utilization
3. **Parallel Advantages**: Significant speedups when parallel features are enabled
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Lower memory overhead for large operations

## Recommendations

- For small arrays (< 1000 elements), NumPy may have slight advantages due to lower overhead
- For large arrays and parallel workloads, SciRS2-Core shows significant performance benefits
- GPU acceleration in SciRS2-Core provides orders of magnitude speedup for suitable operations

## Next Steps

1. Continue optimizing hot paths identified in profiling
2. Implement SIMD optimizations for remaining operations
3. Add more comprehensive GPU kernels
4. Benchmark against other scientific computing libraries (Julia, Matlab)
