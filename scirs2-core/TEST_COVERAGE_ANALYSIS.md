## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CoverageAnalyzer**: Main analysis engine for coverage collection and reporting
2. **CoverageConfig**: Comprehensive configuration management system
3. **FileCoverage**: Detailed per-file coverage tracking and analysis
4. **QualityGateResults**: Automated quality assurance and threshold checking
5. **CoverageReport**: Comprehensive reporting with multiple output formats

### Coverage Data Model

The system tracks coverage at multiple granularities:

```rust
// File-level coverage with detailed metrics
pub struct FileCoverage {
    pub file_path: PathBuf,
    pub total_lines: u32,
    pub covered_lines: u32,
    pub line_hits: BTreeMap<u32, u32>,
    pub branches: Vec<BranchCoverage>,
    pub functions: Vec<FunctionCoverage>,
    pub integrations: Vec<IntegrationPoint>,
}

// Branch coverage with execution patterns
pub struct BranchCoverage {
    pub line_number: u32,
    pub branch_id: String,
    pub true_count: u32,
    pub false_count: u32,
    pub branch_type: BranchType,
    pub source_snippet: String,
}

// Function coverage with complexity metrics
pub struct FunctionCoverage {
    pub function_name: String,
    pub start_line: u32,
    pub end_line: u32,
    pub execution_count: u32,
    pub complexity: u32,
    pub parameter_count: u32,
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Coverage Analysis

```rust
use scirs2_core::profiling::coverage::{
    CoverageAnalyzer, CoverageConfig, CoverageType
};

// Create coverage analyzer
let config = CoverageConfig::default()
    .with_coverage_types(vec![
        CoverageType::Line,
        CoverageType::Branch,
        CoverageType::Function
    ])
    .with_threshold(80.0);

let mut analyzer = CoverageAnalyzer::new(config)?;

// Start coverage collection
analyzer.start_collection()?;

// Run your tests here...
run_test_suite();

// Generate comprehensive report
let report = analyzer.stop_and_generate_report()?;
println!("Coverage: {:.2}%", report.overall_coverage_percentage());
```

### Production Environment Configuration

```rust
// Production-optimized configuration
let config = CoverageConfig::production()
    .with_threshold(85.0)
    .with_branch_threshold(75.0)
    .with_integration_threshold(70.0)
    .with_exclude_patterns(vec![
        "*/tests/*",
        "*/examples/*",
        "*/benches/*"
    ])
    .with_report_format(ReportFormat::Html);

let analyzer = CoverageAnalyzer::new(config)?;
```

### Development Environment with Full Analysis

```rust
// Development configuration with all features
let config = CoverageConfig::development()
    .with_coverage_types(vec![

```

### Quality Gates and Validation

```rust

let report = analyzer.stop_and_generate_report()?;

if report.meets_quality_gates() {
    println!("‚úÖ All quality gates passed!");
} else {
    println!("‚ùå Quality gates failed:");
    for failure in &report.quality_gates.failures {
        println!("  ‚Ä¢ {}: {:.2}% (required: {:.2}%)", 
            failure.gate_type, 
            failure.actual_value, 
            failure.threshold);
    }
}

// Get improvement recommendations
for rec in &report.recommendations {
    println!("üí° {}: {}", rec.recommendation_type, rec.description);
    println!("   Expected impact: +{:.1}% coverage", rec.expected_impact);
}
```

    .with_history_enabled(true)
    .with_history_retention(Duration::from_days(30));

// Analyze trends
if let Some(trends) = report.trends {
    match trends.trend_direction {
        TrendDirection::Improving => println!("üìà Coverage is improving"),
        TrendDirection::Declining => println!("üìâ Coverage is declining"),
        TrendDirection::Stable => println!("‚û°Ô∏è Coverage is stable"),
    }
    
    if let Some(predicted) = trends.predicted_coverage {
        println!("üîÆ Predicted coverage: {:.1}%", predicted);
    }
}
```

### Differential Coverage

```rust
// Enable differential coverage for pull requests
let config = CoverageConfig::default()
    .with_diff_coverage("main")  // Compare against main branch
    .with_enable_diff_coverage(true);

// Analyze only changed code
let report = analyzer.stop_and_generate_report()?;
// Report will focus on coverage of modified/added code
```

### Performance Impact Monitoring

```rust
// Monitor coverage collection overhead
let report = analyzer.stop_and_generate_report()?;
let impact = &report.performance_impact;

println!("Overhead: {:.2}%", impact.execution_overhead_percent);
println!("Memory: {:.1} MB", impact.memory_overhead_bytes as f64 / 1_048_576.0);
println!("Duration: {:.2}s", impact.collection_duration.as_secs_f64());
```

## Integration Patterns

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run Tests with Coverage
  run: cargo test --features profiling
  
- name: Generate Coverage Report
  run: cargo run --example coverage_analysis_demo --features profiling

- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage_reports/coverage.lcov
```

### Quality Gate Enforcement

```rust
// Enforce coverage requirements in CI
let report = analyzer.stop_and_generate_report()?;

if !report.meets_quality_gates() {
    eprintln!("Coverage requirements not met!");
    for failure in &report.quality_gates.failures {
        eprintln!("‚ùå {}: {:.2}% < {:.2}%", 
            failure.gate_type, failure.actual_value, failure.threshold);
    }
    std::process::exit(1);
}
```

### Automated Recommendations

```rust
// Generate and apply coverage improvement suggestions
let recommendations = &report.recommendations;

for rec in recommendations.iter().filter(|r| r.priority >= RecommendationPriority::High) {
    println!("üéØ High Priority: {}", rec.description);
    println!("   Files: {:?}", rec.affected_items);
    println!("   Impact: +{:.1}% coverage", rec.expected_impact);
    println!("   Effort: {:.1} hours", rec.effort_estimate);
}
```

## Best Practices

### Coverage Target Guidelines
- **Unit Tests**: Aim for 90%+ line coverage, 80%+ branch coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Target 70%+ cross-module interaction coverage
- **System Tests**: Focus on end-to-end path coverage
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure coverage of performance-critical paths

### Quality Gate Strategy
- **Development**: Use lenient thresholds to encourage testing
- **Staging**: Enforce moderate coverage requirements
- **Production**: Strict coverage and quality requirements
- **Legacy Code**: Incremental improvement targets

### Performance Considerations
- **Production Sampling**: Use 1-10% sampling rate in production
- **Real-time Updates**: Disable for high-performance scenarios
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports offline
- **Memory Management**: Configure retention periods appropriately

### Integration Testing
- **Module Boundaries**: Focus on interface coverage
- **Error Paths**: Ensure error handling is tested
- **Concurrency**: Test thread-safe operations
- **Resource Management**: Verify cleanup and disposal

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**High Memory Usage**
```rust
// Reduce memory footprint
let config = CoverageConfig::production()
    .with_sampling_rate(0.05)      // Lower sampling rate
    .with_max_data_points(500)     // Limit data retention
    .with_real_time_updates(false); // Disable real-time processing
```

**Performance Impact**
```rust
// Minimize performance overhead
let config = CoverageConfig::default()
    .with_coverage_types(vec![CoverageType::Line]) // Reduce tracked types
    .with_sampling_rate(0.1)                       // Sample only 10%
    .with_include_system_code(false);              // Exclude system code
```

**Large Codebases**
```rust
// Handle large codebases efficiently
let config = CoverageConfig::default()
    .with_exclude_patterns(vec![
        "*/vendor/*",
        "*/third_party/*",
        "*/generated/*"
    ])
    .with_chunk_wise_processing(true);
```
