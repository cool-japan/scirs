# Fast Kriging Refactoring Issues

When refactoring the `fast_kriging.rs` file into a modular structure, several issues were identified that need to be addressed:

## Import and Export Issues

1. `FastPredictionResult` struct is not being properly exported from the module structure
2. Missing builder methods in `FastKrigingBuilder` (seems like they should be methods but are being treated as fields)
3. Missing variants in the `InterpolateError` enum (`MissingPoints` and `MissingValues`)

## API Compatibility Issues

1. The signature of `AnisotropicCovariance::new()` needs to be updated - the function expects 5 arguments but we're providing 4
2. `builder.length_scales` returns an `Array1<F>` but `AnisotropicCovariance::new()` expects a `Vec<F>`

## Path Resolution Issues

1. Module conflict between `fast_kriging.rs` and `fast_kriging/mod.rs` (fixed by renaming to `fast_kriging_reexports.rs`)
2. Incorrect import paths in the refactored modules

## Code Issues

1. Many unused imports throughout the refactored code
2. Unused variable `model` in `variogram.rs`
3. Feature flag `std` is used but not defined in `Cargo.toml`

## Recommended Fixes

1. Carefully review the original code and ensure all structs/enums are properly defined and exported
2. Fix the builder methods in `FastKrigingBuilder` to be actual methods rather than fields
3. Convert `Array1<F>` to `Vec<F>` when calling `AnisotropicCovariance::new()`
4. Add the missing variants to `InterpolateError` or use existing variants
5. Clean up unused imports
6. Replace `#[cfg(feature = "std")]` with a condition that works in this codebase

## Strategy

Due to the complexity of the issues, it might be easier to take a more incremental approach to refactoring this file:

1. Start with the original file and first extract just the core types without changing any functionality
2. Get that working correctly before extracting the implementation details into separate files
3. Test each step of the refactoring to ensure compatibility is maintained

Alternatively, since we already have the files split up, we can focus on fixing the issues one by one, starting with the most critical compatibility issues.
