# GPU Acceleration Roadmap for scirs2-fft

This document outlines the development roadmap for implementing full GPU acceleration in the scirs2-fft crate, with a focus on sparse FFT operations.

## Current Status

The initial framework for GPU acceleration has been implemented, including:

- `sparse_fft_gpu.rs`: Core GPU-accelerated sparse FFT functionality
- `sparse_fft_gpu_memory.rs`: Memory management utilities for GPU operations
- Example: `gpu_sparse_fft_example.rs` and `gpu_memory_optimization_example.rs`
- Benchmarks: `gpu_sparse_fft_bench.rs`

These components provide a solid foundation for further development, although they currently use CPU fallback implementations rather than actual GPU code.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: CUDA Implementation (High Priority)

   - Test on AMD GPUs

2. **AMD-specific optimizations:**
   - Optimize for AMD GPU architecture 
   - Leverage wave32/wave64 execution models
   - Implement AMD-specific memory handling

### Phase 3: SYCL Implementation

1. **Cross-platform SYCL implementation:**
   - Implement SYCL kernels for sparse FFT operations
   - Ensure compatibility with multiple backends (Intel, NVIDIA, AMD)
   - Setup oneAPI integration

2. **Cross-platform memory management:**
   - Unified memory model across devices
   - Backend-specific optimizations
   - Error handling for different hardware

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

1. **Multi-GPU support:**
   - Distribute work across multiple GPUs
   - Implement inter-GPU communication
   - Scale with available hardware

2. **Hybrid CPU-GPU execution:**
   - Adaptive execution based on workload size and hardware
   - Task scheduling between CPU and GPU
   - Dynamic load balancing

3. **Advanced memory optimizations:**
   - Mixed-precision computation
   - Memory compression techniques
   - Out-of-core processing for very large signals

4. **Kernel auto-tuning:**
   - Parameter optimization for different GPU models
   - Performance-based kernel selection
   - Dynamic adjustment based on runtime factors

## Testing Strategy

1. **Correctness testing:**
   - Check numerical accuracy against CPU implementations
   - Test edge cases and signal types
   - Verify consistency across backends

2. **Performance testing:**
   - Benchmark against CPU implementations
   - Compare with SciPy/FFTW performance
   - Measure memory usage and transfer costs

3. **Cross-platform validation:**
   - Test on different GPU vendors
   - Verify compatible behavior across platforms
   - Test on both workstations and HPC environments

## Integration Plan

1. **Feature-gated compilation:**
   - Make GPU support optional through feature flags
   - Add separate features for each backend (cuda, hip, sycl)
   - Ensure core functionality works without GPU support

2. **Build system integration:**
   - Setup CI pipeline for GPU testing
   - Provide build instructions for each backend
   - Automated testing on different hardware

3. **Documentation:**
   - Clear API documentation for GPU features
   - Performance guidelines and recommendations
   - Installation instructions for different platforms
