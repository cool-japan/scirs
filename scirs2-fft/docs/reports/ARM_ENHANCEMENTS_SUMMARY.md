# ARM Platform Support Enhancements Summary

This document summarizes all the enhancements made to the scirs2-fft library to improve performance on ARM platforms using NEON SIMD instructions.

## 1. FFT Adaptive Dispatchers

We've updated all FFT adaptive dispatchers to automatically use NEON-accelerated implementations on ARM platforms:

- **1D FFT**: `fft_adaptive` and `ifft_adaptive`
- **2D FFT**: `fft2_adaptive` and `ifft2_adaptive`
- **N-dimensional FFT**: `fftn_adaptive` and `ifftn_adaptive`

These dispatchers now detect ARM's aarch64 architecture and automatically select the optimized implementation without any additional configuration.

## 2. SIMD-optimized RFFT Implementation

Added a completely new SIMD-accelerated implementation for real-valued FFT operations:

- **Forward RFFT**: `rfft_simd` and `rfft_adaptive` functions
- **Inverse RFFT**: `irfft_simd` and `irfft_adaptive` functions

These specialized implementations deliver better performance for real-valued signals, which are common in many applications like audio processing, scientific measurements, and sensor data analysis.

## 3. Memory-Efficient FFT Improvements

Enhanced the memory-efficient FFT implementation to leverage SIMD acceleration:

- Updated `fft_inplace` to use SIMD acceleration for large arrays
- Added threshold-based switching between standard and SIMD implementations
- Optimized normalization using NEON vector instructions

## 4. Performance Benchmarks

Created comprehensive benchmarks to measure and verify performance improvements:

- **General FFT benchmarks**: Compare standard vs. NEON-accelerated implementations
- **RFFT-specific benchmarks**: Measure performance gains for real-valued FFT operations
- **Size-based comparisons**: Evaluate performance across different input sizes

## 5. Testing and Validation

Added robust testing to ensure correctness of the NEON-accelerated implementations:

- **ARM-specific test module**: Tests specifically for aarch64 architecture
- **RFFT validation tests**: Verify that real FFT operations produce correct results
- **Roundtrip tests**: Ensure that forward + inverse transforms recover the original signal

## 6. Documentation and Examples

Created comprehensive documentation and examples for ARM support:

- **ARM_NEON_SUPPORT.md**: Detailed documentation of ARM-specific optimizations
- **SIMD-accelerated example**: Demonstrates performance improvements on real-world signals
- **API documentation**: Updated with information about NEON acceleration

8. `src/arm_fft_test.rs`: ARM-specific tests for validation

## Performance Improvements

Expected performance improvements on ARM platforms:

- **1D FFT**: 1.5-3x faster for large arrays (N > 1024)
- **2D FFT**: 1.5-2.5x faster for large matrices
- **Real FFT (RFFT)**: 2-4x faster than standard implementation
- **Normalization**: 3-6x faster using NEON vector instructions

## Future Improvement Areas

1. Implementation of SIMD-accelerated rfft2 and rfftn operations
2. Further optimization of memory access patterns for improved cache utilization
3. Support for half-precision (f16) operations on newer ARM processors
4. Integration with ARM's SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) when available
5. Parallel execution optimization for multi-core ARM processors
