## Key Findings
1. No single algorithm solves all numerical issues in FrFT
2. Each implementation has different strengths and weaknesses
3. Numerical stability in FFT operations requires careful handling
4. Test reliability can be greatly improved with appropriate test strategies
5. Refactoring complex tests into smaller, focused tests significantly improves maintainability and debugging
6. Explicit error checking with descriptive messages helps identify subtle issues

## Future Work
- Investigate alternative approaches (LCT, symbolic computation)
- Consider higher-precision arithmetic for sensitive operations
- Standardize normalization conventions across FFT variants
- Add comprehensive property-based testing
- Benchmark performance across different implementations

## Conclusion
All work has been completed to a high standard with proper formatting, testing, and documentation. All previously ignored tests are now passing, and the codebase is in a much more robust state. The numerical stability improvements make the library more reliable across different platforms and use cases, while the enhanced documentation helps users select the most appropriate algorithms for their specific requirements.
