# FFT Implementation Fixes Summary

## Completed Fixes

### Type Consistency Improvements

- Fixed mismatched types in `rfft.rs` functions:
  - Updated `fft2`, `ifft2`, `fftn`, and `ifftn` calls to use proper owned arrays instead of views
  - Changed code to use `to_owned()` when calling functions that expect owned arrays
  - Made type signatures consistent between function declarations and usage

### Code Quality Improvements

- Fixed warnings about unused code:
  - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations with documentation for fields that are currently unused but preserved for future use
  - Added documentation to utility functions marked as dead code but kept for API consistency
  - Removed actual dead code that was no longer needed

### Examples and Tests

- Fixed all examples to ensure they compile correctly:
  - Updated parameter types in function calls
  - Made sure view/owned array types match function requirements
  - Fixed configuration structures to match current API
  - Updated return value handling in examples with conditional branching

## Known Issues

### OpenBLAS Linking

- There's an issue with linking OpenBLAS that prevents tests from running
- Added a temporary fix in `.cargo/config.toml` with appropriate linking flags
- This is likely a system-specific issue and would require additional configuration on each system

### Performance Concerns

- Some files take a long time to compile, suggesting potential performance optimizations
- The complex array conversion and allocation patterns might benefit from optimization
- Consider implementing more in-place operations to reduce memory usage

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Improve API Consistency**: 
   - Make function signatures more consistent across the codebase
   - Consider making functions consistently accept either views or owned arrays

2. **Optimize Memory Usage**:
   - Reduce temporary allocations in FFT operations
   - Implement more in-place operations where possible

3. **Enhance Test Coverage**:
   - Add more unit tests for edge cases
   - Improve integration tests to verify compatibility with SciPy's FFT implementation

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Review dependencies to reduce compilation time
   - Make optional dependencies truly optional where possible
   - Consider providing pre-compiled binaries for common platforms

5. **Documentation**:
   - Improve documentation with more examples
   - Clarify function parameter requirements (owned vs view)
