# ndarray-linalg Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration from ndarray-linalg to scirs2-core abstractions in the scirs2-neural module.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependency Update
- **File**: `Cargo.toml`
- **Status**: Already commented out
- The `ndarray-linalg` dependency was already commented out (line 24)

### 2. Code Updates

#### memory_efficient.rs
- **Location**: Lines 688-699
- **Change**: Replaced `ndarray::linalg::Dot` trait usage with manual matrix multiplication
- **Implementation**: 
  ```rust
  // Old code:
  use ndarray::linalg::Dot;
  let mut result = input_2d.dot(&weights_2d);
  
  // New code:
  // TODO: Replace with scirs2-core matrix multiplication when available
  // For now, using manual matrix multiplication
  let mut result = ndarray::Array2::<f32>::zeros((input_2d.shape()[0], weights_2d.shape()[1]));
  for i in 0..input_2d.shape()[0] {
      for j in 0..weights_2d.shape()[1] {
          let mut sum = 0.0f32;
          for k in 0..input_2d.shape()[1] {
              sum += input_2d[[i, k]] * weights_2d[[k, j]];
          }
          result[[i, j]] = sum;
      }
  }
  ```

### 3. Other Files
The following files were checked and found to have no direct ndarray-linalg usage:
- `linalg/batch_operations/matmul.rs` - Uses manual matrix multiplication
- `linalg/batch_operations/normalization.rs` - Uses manual operations
- `linalg/batch_operations/convolution.rs` - Uses manual convolution operations
- `linalg/batch_operations/attention.rs` - Uses manual attention computations
- `linalg/batch_operations/rnn.rs` - Uses manual RNN computations

## Future Work

### TODO Items Added
1. **Matrix Multiplication**: Replace manual matrix multiplication in `memory_efficient.rs` with scirs2-core matrix multiplication when available

### Recommended scirs2-core Additions
To fully support neural network operations, scirs2-core should consider adding:
1. Efficient matrix multiplication (GEMM) operations
2. Batch matrix multiplication support
3. Transposed matrix multiplication variants
4. Specialized neural network operations (conv2d, attention, etc.)

## Testing
- All existing tests pass with the manual implementations
- No functionality has been lost in the migration
- Performance may be impacted compared to BLAS-backed operations

## Notes
- The manual implementations are correct but may not be as performant as optimized BLAS operations
- When scirs2-core adds proper linear algebra support, these manual implementations should be replaced
- The code is now fully independent of ndarray-linalg
