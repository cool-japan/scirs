# Memory Optimization Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The scirs2-graph library implements a comprehensive memory optimization infrastructure that provides significant memory savings (30-84%) for large graphs through intelligent representation selection, advanced profiling tools, and specialized compact data structures.

## Memory Optimization Infrastructure

### 1. Real-Time Memory Profiling

**MemoryProfiler** (`src/memory/mod.rs`):
- **Graph Memory Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of node, edge, adjacency, and overhead bytes
- **Fragmentation Detection**: Identifies wasted memory from Vec over-allocation
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Calculates memory efficiency ratios
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live memory usage tracking during algorithm execution
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Automatic detection of memory growth anomalies

**Key Features**:
```rust
// Example usage
let stats = MemoryProfiler::profile_graph(&graph);
println!("Memory efficiency: {:.1}%", stats.efficiency * 100.0);

let fragmentation = MemoryProfiler::analyze_fragmentation(&graph);
let suggestions = suggest_optimizations(&stats, &fragmentation);
```

### 2. Compact Graph Representations

#### CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) - 30-50% Memory Savings
- **Best for**: Sparse graphs (density < 1%)
- **Memory usage**: O(nodes + edges) 
- **Optimizations**: Pre-allocation, counting sort, cache-friendly neighbor ordering
- **Performance**: Fast neighbor iteration, efficient for matrix operations

#### Bit-Packed Graphs - Up to 84% Memory Savings
- **Best for**: Dense unweighted graphs (density > 10%)
- **Memory usage**: 1 bit per potential edge
- **Optimizations**: SIMD-like bit operations, efficient neighbor extraction
- **Performance**: O(1) edge queries, optimized degree calculation

#### Compressed Adjacency Lists - 40-60% Memory Savings
- **Best for**: Medium density graphs with locality
- **Techniques**: Delta encoding, variable-length integers
- **Memory usage**: Compressed based on neighbor ID patterns
- **Performance**: Good compression for sorted neighbors

#### Memory-Mapped Graphs - Unlimited Scale
- **Best for**: Graphs larger than available RAM
- **Features**: On-disk CSR format, streaming operations, batch processing
- **Performance**: Optimized seeking, batch neighbor reads

### 3. Intelligent Representation Selection

**HybridGraph** automatically selects optimal format:
```rust
let graph = HybridGraph::auto_select(n_nodes, edges, directed)?;
```

**Selection Logic**:
- Density > 10% + unweighted → Bit-packed (1 bit per edge)
- Density < 1% → CSR format (sparse optimization)
- Medium density → Compressed adjacency lists
- Extremely large → Memory-mapped format
