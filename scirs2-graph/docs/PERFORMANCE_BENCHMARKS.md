## Performance Tips

### For Best Performance

1. **Use release builds**: `cargo build --release`
2. **Enable target-specific optimizations**: `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"`
3. **Choose appropriate graph representation**: sparse vs dense
4. **Enable parallel features**: `features = ["parallel"]`
5. **Use appropriate data types**: prefer primitive types when possible

2. **Minimize node/edge data size**
3. **Use streaming operations** for very large graphs
4. **Enable memory profiling** for optimization

### Scaling Guidelines

- **Small graphs** (<1K nodes): All algorithms perform well
- **Medium graphs** (1K-100K nodes): Optimal performance range
- **Large graphs** (100K-1M nodes): Use parallel algorithms
- **Massive graphs** (>1M nodes): Consider streaming/external processing
