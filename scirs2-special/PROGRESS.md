# Progress on Special Functions Module

## Implemented Functions

We have successfully implemented the following special functions:

1. **Basic Special Functions**
   - Gamma and related functions
   - Error functions
   - Bessel functions
   - Orthogonal polynomials

2. **Advanced Functions**
   - Airy functions
   - Elliptic integrals and functions
   - Hypergeometric functions
   - Mathieu functions
   - Zeta functions
   - Kelvin functions
   - Struve functions
   - Fresnel integrals
   - Parabolic cylinder functions
   - Lambert W function
   - Wright Omega function
   - Logarithmic integral

3. **Recently Added Functions**
   - Spheroidal wave functions (prolate and oblate)
   - Wright Bessel functions
   - Coulomb wave functions

## Current Status

The module structure is well-established, with numerous special functions implemented. We have:

- Complete implementations of many common special functions
- Basic implementations with placeholders for newer functions
- Example code for each function family
- Basic tests for the main functionality

## Build Issues

There are several build issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Parameter Mismatches**: The gamma function calls in parabolic.rs need to be fixed.
2. **Unused Variables**: Several unused variables throughout the codebase (already fixed some in the spheroidal, coulomb, and fresnel modules).
3. **Type Annotations**: Missing type annotations in some function implementations.
4. **Error Handling**: Inconsistencies in handling errors from Result types.

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining build issues, particularly in:
   - parabolic.rs
   - Other modules with type mismatches

2. Enhance numerical precision:
   - Improve algorithms for edge cases
   - Better handling of overflow and underflow
   - Add extended precision options where appropriate

3. Optimize performance:
   - Use more efficient algorithms
   - Implement precomputed coefficients and lookup tables
   - Add SIMD optimizations for vector operations

4. Add comprehensive tests:
   - Test against known values from SciPy
   - Add property-based tests for mathematical identities
   - Test edge cases with extreme parameter values

5. Improve documentation:
   - Add more detailed examples
   - Document mathematical background
   - Document performance characteristics

6. Add array support:
   - Support for multidimensional arrays
   - Vectorized operations
   - Lazy evaluation for large arrays

## Long-term Goals

- Performance comparable to or better than SciPy
- Support for arbitrary precision computation
- Full coverage of all SciPy special functions
- Integration with other scientific computing modules
