# Implementation Notes for Special Functions Module

## Recent Enhancements

We have successfully implemented several new special functions to complement the existing SciRS special module:

1. **Spheroidal Wave Functions**
   - Prolate spheroidal functions and their derivatives
   - Oblate spheroidal functions and their derivatives
   - Characteristic values for both prolate and oblate functions
   - Provides a foundation for full implementations that comply with SciPy

2. **Wright Bessel Functions**
   - Basic implementation for real arguments
   - Framework for complex arguments
   - Structure for computing zeros (not fully implemented)

3. **Coulomb Wave Functions**
   - Framework for regular and irregular Coulomb functions
   - Phase shift calculations
   - Outgoing and incoming complex Coulomb wave functions

4. **Logarithmic Integral**
   - Implementation of Li(x) for real arguments
   - Structure for complex arguments
   - Related exponential integral functions

## Implementation Strategy

Our implementation strategy focuses on:

1. **API Compatibility**: Following SciPy's interface for consistency
2. **Numerical Stability**: Handling edge cases and extreme parameter values
3. **Performance**: Using optimized algorithms where possible
4. **Documentation**: Providing clear, comprehensive documentation with examples

## Current Limitations

While the basic structure is in place, there are several limitations in the current implementation:

1. **Incomplete Implementations**:
   - Many functions are placeholder implementations
   - Some complex-valued functions only work with real arguments
   - The most advanced numerical methods are not yet implemented

2. **Numerical Issues**:
   - Better handling of overflow and underflow needed
   - Extended precision options not implemented
   - Asymptotic expansions needed for extreme parameter values

3. **Performance**:
   - Need more efficient algorithms for evaluation
   - Precomputed coefficients and lookup tables to be added
   - SIMD and parallelization not implemented

4. **Testing**:
   - More comprehensive tests needed
   - Property-based testing for mathematical identities
   - Comparison with reference values from SciPy

## Next Steps

The following improvements should be prioritized:

1. **Implement full numerical methods** for each function
2. **Enhance error handling and numerical stability**
3. **Add comprehensive test suite**
4. **Optimize performance-critical sections**
5. **Add support for array operations**
6. **Complete documentation with examples**

## Architectural Decisions

1. **Function Interface**: We've maintained consistency with SciPy where possible
2. **Error Handling**: Using `SpecialResult` for robust error reporting
3. **Type System**: Leveraging Rust's type system for safety and clarity
4. **Modularity**: Each function family in its own module for better organization

## Build and Test

The module builds successfully now, though there are some warnings that should be addressed in future iterations. All functions have at least basic test coverage, with more comprehensive tests needed as implementations mature.

## Conclusion

The special functions module is growing in functionality and is on track to provide a comprehensive, Rust-native alternative to SciPy's special module. The structure is in place for further enhancements and optimizations.
