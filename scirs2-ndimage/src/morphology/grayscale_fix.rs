//! Fixed implementations of grayscale morphological operations
//!
//! The same as grayscale.rs but with more stable implementations that better handle
//! different dimensionality scenarios.

// This file is now empty as we've moved all functionality to grayscale.rs
// It is kept for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future version

// No new implementation in this file as we're using the improved version from grayscale.rs
