//! Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
//!
//! This module provides implementations of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT),
//! inverse DWT, and associated wavelet filters. The DWT is useful for
//! multi-resolution analysis, denoising, and compression of signals.
//!
//! The functionality is organized into submodules within the `dwt` directory:
//! 
//! - `filters`: Wavelet filter definitions and generation functions
//! - `transform`: Core DWT decomposition and reconstruction functions
//! - `boundary`: Signal extension methods for handling boundary conditions
//! - `multiscale`: Multi-level transform functions for decomposition and reconstruction

// Re-export public items from the DWT submodules
