# DWT Module Refactoring

## Overview

The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) module has been refactored to improve code organization, maintainability, and extensibility. This document explains the refactoring process and the new module structure.

## Why Refactor?

The original implementation had all the DWT functionality in a single file (`dwt.rs`), which made it difficult to navigate, understand, and maintain. The refactoring aims to address the following issues:

1. **Code Organization**: Group related functionality together
2. **Maintainability**: Make it easier to modify individual components
3. **Extensibility**: Allow for easier addition of new wavelet types and algorithms
4. **Readability**: Improve code documentation and structure

## New Module Structure

The refactored DWT module is now organized into submodules:

1. **`filters.rs`**: Definitions for different wavelets and their filter coefficients
   - `Wavelet` enum for wavelet types (Haar, DB, Sym, etc.)
   - `WaveletFilters` struct for storing filter coefficients
   - Implementation of different wavelet filter generation functions

2. **`transform.rs`**: Core DWT decomposition and reconstruction functions
   - `dwt_decompose()`: Single-level wavelet decomposition
   - `dwt_reconstruct()`: Single-level wavelet reconstruction

3. **`boundary.rs`**: Signal extension methods
   - `extend_signal()`: Extends signals at boundaries using various methods (symmetric, periodic, etc.)

4. **`multiscale.rs`**: Multi-level transform functions
   - `wavedec()`: Multi-level wavelet decomposition
   - `waverec()`: Multi-level wavelet reconstruction

## Implementation Details

The refactoring maintains the same public API as the original implementation, ensuring backward compatibility. The key improvements include:

1. **Cleaner Code Organization**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Better Documentation**: More detailed docstrings and comments
3. **Improved Type Safety**: Better handling of edge cases and error conditions
4. **Enhanced Testability**: Dedicated test files for each component

## Future Improvements

This refactoring sets the stage for future enhancements:

1. **Additional Wavelet Types**: The modular structure makes it easier to add new wavelet families
2. **Performance Optimizations**: Isolated components can be optimized independently
3. **Extended Functionality**: New signal extension methods, multiscale analysis techniques, etc.
4. **Hardware Acceleration**: Potential for SIMD and GPU acceleration in performance-critical parts

## Usage

The public API remains unchanged, so existing code using the DWT module should continue to work without modification. Users can still access the main functions through the regular imports:

```rust
use scirs2_signal::dwt::{dwt_decompose, dwt_reconstruct, wavedec, waverec, Wavelet};
```

## Testing

A new test suite has been added to verify the correctness of the refactored implementation. The tests cover:

1. Single-level DWT decomposition and reconstruction
2. Multi-level wavelet analysis
3. Different wavelet types (Haar, Daubechies, etc.)
4. Edge cases and error handling
