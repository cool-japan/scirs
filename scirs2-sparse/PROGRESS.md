## Implementation Notes

- The array API differs from the matrix API in key ways:
  - `*` operator performs element-wise multiplication, not matrix multiplication
  - Matrix multiplication is done with the `dot` method
  - Operations like `sum` produce arrays, not matrices
  - Sparse arrays use array-style slicing operations

- Performance optimizations will be added after core functionality is complete
  - SIMD operations where appropriate
  - GPU acceleration for compatible operations
  - Cache-friendly storage formats

- The matrix API is maintained for backward compatibility but marked as legacy
