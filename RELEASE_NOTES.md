### Linear Algebra Operations
```rust
use scirs2_linalg::{basic, decomposition};
use ndarray::array;

// Create a matrix
let a = array![[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]];

// Compute determinant and inverse
let det = basic::det(&a).unwrap();
let inv = basic::inv(&a).unwrap();

// Perform matrix decomposition

```rust
use scirs2_stats::distributions::normal::Normal;

// Create a normal distribution
let normal = Normal::new(0.0, 1.0).unwrap();

// Calculate PDF, CDF, and quantiles
let pdf = normal.pdf(1.0)?;
let cdf = normal.cdf(1.0)?;
let ppf = normal.ppf(0.975)?;

// Generate random samples
let samples = normal.random_sample(1000, None)?;
```

```rust
use scirs2_optimize::unconstrained;

// Define objective function and gradient
let f = |x: &[f64]| x[0].powi(2) + x[1].powi(2);
let df = |x: &[f64], grad: &mut [f64]| {
    grad[0] = 2.0 * x[0];
    grad[1] = 2.0 * x[1];
};

// Minimize using BFGS
