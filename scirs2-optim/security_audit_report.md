  - Recommendation: Standardize on rand v0.9.x across all modules

### Transitive Dependencies Analysis

#### Potential Security Concerns
1. **libc v0.2.174**
   - Status: Current
   - Risk: Low (essential system interface)
   - Note: Critical for FFI safety

2. **chrono v0.4.41**
   - Status: Potential for time-related vulnerabilities
   - Risk: Low-Medium
   - Recommendation: Ensure timezone handling is secure

3. **crossbeam family** ✅
   - Status: Well-maintained concurrency primitives
   - Risk: Low

## Security Vulnerabilities Assessment

### Known Issues
- No critical security vulnerabilities detected in direct dependencies
- Version conflicts may lead to undefined behavior (low probability)

### Plugin System Security Enhancements
The plugin system has been enhanced with comprehensive security features:

1. **Cryptographic Signature Verification**
   - RSA and ECDSA signature support
   - Certificate chain validation
   - Configurable security policies

2. **Plugin Integrity Monitoring**
   - SHA-256 hash verification
   - Plugin allowlisting
   - Integrity violation detection

3. **Sandbox Configuration**
   - Process isolation capabilities
   - Memory and CPU time limits
   - Network and filesystem access controls

4. **Permission System**
   - Fine-grained permission model
   - Forbidden permission enforcement
   - Dynamic permission validation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts**
   ```toml
   # Update workspace Cargo.toml to standardize versions
   rand = "0.9.1"  # Use consistent version across all modules
   ```

2. **Enhanced Security Monitoring**
   - Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Set up regular security audit schedule (monthly)
   - Monitor security advisories for core dependencies

3. **Plugin Security Policy**
   ```rust
   // Recommended security policy for production
   SecurityPolicy {
       allow_unsigned: false,
       signature_verification: SignatureVerificationConfig {
           enabled: true,
           required_algorithm: SignatureAlgorithm::RSA4096_SHA256,
           min_key_size: 4096,
           allow_self_signed: false,
           max_chain_depth: 3,
           check_revocation: true,
           validation_timeout: Duration::from_secs(30),
       },
       plugin_allowlist: vec![], // Populate with approved plugin hashes
       integrity_monitoring: true,
       enable_code_scanning: true,
       sandbox_config: SandboxConfig {
           process_isolation: true,
           memory_limit: 256 * 1024 * 1024, // 256MB
           cpu_time_limit: 30.0, // 30 seconds
           network_access: false,
           filesystem_access: vec![PathBuf::from("./tmp")],
       },
   }
   ```

### Medium Priority Actions

1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Monitor for security updates to ndarray-linalg
   - Consider upgrading to newer versions of numerical libraries
   - Evaluate alternatives for deprecated dependencies

2. **Security Testing**
   - Implement fuzz testing for plugin loading
   - Add integration tests for security features
   - Test signature verification edge cases

3. **Documentation**
   - Create security best practices guide for plugin developers
   - Document security configuration options
   - Provide examples of secure plugin implementations

### Long-term Security Strategy

1. **Supply Chain Security**
   - Implement dependency pinning for critical releases
   - Consider using cargo-deny for dependency policy enforcement
   - Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD

2. **Runtime Security**
   - Consider implementing runtime application self-protection (RASP)
   - Add telemetry for security events
   - Implement rate limiting for plugin operations

3. **Compliance**
   - Evaluate compliance with relevant security standards
   - Document security architecture decisions
   - Prepare for security certifications if needed
