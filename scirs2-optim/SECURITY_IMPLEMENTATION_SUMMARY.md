## Usage Instructions

### Running Security Audits

```bash
# Manual security audit
./scripts/dependency_audit.sh

# Install required tools (done automatically)
cargo install cargo-audit cargo-deny cargo-outdated

# Quick vulnerability check
cargo audit

# Check for outdated dependencies
cargo outdated

# License and policy compliance
cargo deny check
```

### CI/CD Integration

The security workflow can be adapted for various CI systems:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions (included)
.github/security_check.yml

# GitLab CI (adaptation needed)
.gitlab-ci.yml

# Jenkins (adaptation needed)
Jenkinsfile
```

### Plugin Security Configuration

```rust
// Production security policy
let security_policy = SecurityPolicy {
    allow_unsigned: false,
    signature_verification: SignatureVerificationConfig {
        enabled: true,
        required_algorithm: SignatureAlgorithm::RSA4096_SHA256,
        min_key_size: 4096,
        allow_self_signed: false,
        check_revocation: true,
    },
    plugin_allowlist: approved_hashes,
    integrity_monitoring: true,
    sandbox_config: SandboxConfig {
        process_isolation: true,
        memory_limit: 256 * 1024 * 1024,
        network_access: false,
    },
};
```
