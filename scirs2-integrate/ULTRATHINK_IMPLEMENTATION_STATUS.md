# Ultrathink Mode Implementation Status

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Production Ready
**Date**: January 2025
**Version**: 0.1.0-beta.1

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Summary

The scirs2-integrate ultrathink mode implementation is **COMPLETE** and **PRODUCTION-READY**. All major features have been successfully implemented with comprehensive testing and no outstanding TODO items.

## âœ… Completed Major Components

### 1. **Newton Iteration Fix for Mass Matrix Systems** 
**File**: `src/ode/methods/radau_mass.rs` (Lines 453-460)

**Issue Resolved**: The Radau method's Newton iteration for mass matrix systems has been corrected.

**Fix Applied**: 
```rust
// CORRECTED RHS: The right-hand side should be -M * residual, not just -residual
// This is the key fix for the Newton iteration convergence
let mut rhs = Array1::<F>::zeros(n_dim);
for i in 0..n_dim {
    for j in 0..n_dim {
        rhs[i] -= m[[i, j]] * residual[j];
    }
}

**Impact**: Mass matrix systems now converge properly with the Radau method.
